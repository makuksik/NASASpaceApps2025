# NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE 2025

# üöÄ Impact Zone

Impact Zone is an emergency response application designed to assess and visualize the potential impact of incoming asteroids. It analyzes real-time data to determine the level of risk, predicts affected zones, and guides users toward the safest evacuation routes and shelters based on their current location.

By integrating NASA asteroid datasets, geolocation services, and Google Maps API, the app transforms complex space data into clear, actionable insights accessible to everyone.

# üåç Vision

While currently focused on asteroid threats, Impact Zone is built to evolve into a universal emergency alert system. Future expansions aim to cover:

- Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods)
- Radioactive contamination
- Conflict-related hazards

Integrated with public platforms like **mObywatel**, it could deliver life-saving information instantly to every citizen.
